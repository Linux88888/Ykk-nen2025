## Comparison with Our Model

### Championship Race

Our model predicts **FC Lahti** to win the championship with a 54.8% probability, which aligns closely with the community consensus. The key factors are similar:

- **Forum View**: FC Lahti's Veikkausliiga experience and stronger squad depth
- **Our Model**: FC Lahti's superior player quality ratings and goal-scoring potential

**TPS** is the second most likely champion in both our model (48.3% promotion probability) and the community predictions.

**Jippo** is rated slightly higher in our model (42.5% promotion probability) than in the community predictions, likely because our model gives more weight to their strong start.

### Relegation Battle

There's strong agreement regarding **SalPa** as the most likely relegation candidate:
- Our model gives them a 68.7% relegation probability
- The community unanimously includes them in their relegation picks

The most notable difference concerns **HJK Klubi 04**:
- Community predictions often place them as relegation candidates (20% of votes)
- Our model rates them slightly higher (mid-table probability of 49.8%) due to factoring in the technical ability of their young players

**PK-35**'s position is similarly rated:
- Our model: 63.5% relegation probability
- Community predictions: Frequently mentioned as relegation candidates (20% of votes)

### Notable Differences

1. **EIF's Prospects**:
   - Community: Some see them as high as runner-up
   - Our model: Solid mid-table team (4th place finish) with 61.7% mid-table probability

2. **SJK Akatemia's Chances**:
   - Community: Some relegation concern
   - Our model: Mid-table finish (6th place) with 54.6% mid-table probability

3. **Goal Scorer Predictions**:
   - Community predictions focus heavily on known veterans like Eero Markkanen
   - Our model includes newer signings like Aaron Lindholm prominently

## Why the Differences?

1. **Recency Bias**: The forum community may place more weight on past seasons' performances, while our model emphasizes recent form and transfer activity.

2. **Home Advantage Quantification**: Our model specifically quantifies home advantage effects, which may not be explicitly considered in forum discussions.

3. **Point Deduction Impact**: Our model mathematically accounts for PK-35's 2-point deduction, while fan predictions may overestimate its psychological impact.

4. **Development Teams Perception**: There's typically more skepticism about academy teams like HJK Klubi 04 and SJK Akatemia in community predictions than in our statistics-based approach.

## Areas of Agreement

1. **Title Favorites**: Both approaches see FC Lahti and TPS as the strongest championship contenders.

2. **SalPa's Struggles**: Universal agreement on SalPa's relegation risk.

3. **Top Scorer Candidates**: Players from the strongest teams (FC Lahti, TPS) dominate both our model and community predictions for the golden boot race.

## Conclusion

The community predictions from Futisforum2 provide valuable context and largely align with our model, particularly regarding the title favorites and main relegation candidate. Where differences exist, they highlight areas to monitor throughout the season to refine both the statistical model and community expectations.

As the season progresses, we'll update this comparison to track how both predictive approaches perform against actual results.
